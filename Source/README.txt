MetaChem

Version:
Beta v1.0



Description:
The MetaChem is built on the Meta Preview by Meta Company. 
With MetaChem, 
1. you can visualize chemical molecules in augmented reality.
2. you can build your own molecule by hands or importing a PDBML/XML file.
3. you can modify the current structure by adding and deleting atoms.
4. you can adjust the currrent structure by moving, rotating atoms.
5. you can measure the distance, angle and dihedral. 
6. you can operate multiple atoms together.

Instructions:
1. Launch MetaChem: 
		    (a). create a new 3D project in Unity
                    (b). import MetaChem package and Meta package
                    (c). open scene MetaPreviewScene         

2. Operate multiple atoms:
                    Option 1. choose Group function, define a model with serveral atoms    
                    Option 2. choose SelectAll function, define a model with all the atoms
