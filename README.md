### How do I get set up? ###

1. Launch ChemPreview as an App: 

              unzip app.xip, then double click ChemPreview.exe app.

2. Run ChemPreview in Unity:

              unzip source.zip, then import ChemPreview.unitypackage    

3. Operate multiple atoms:

                  Option 1. choose Group function, define a model with serveral atoms    
                  Option 2. choose SelectAll function, define a model with all the atoms


  

### Function guidelines ###

With ChemPreview.

1. you can visualize chemical molecules in augmented reality.
2. you can build your own molecule by hands or importing a PDBML/XML file.
3. you can modify the current structure by adding and deleting atoms.
4. you can adjust the currrent structure by moving, rotating atoms.
5. you can measure the distance, angle and dihedral. 
6. you can operate multiple atoms together.
