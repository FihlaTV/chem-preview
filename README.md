### How do I get set up? ###

1. Launch MetaChem: 

                  double click MetaChem.exe app.

2. Operate multiple atoms:

                  Option 1. choose Group function, define a model with serveral atoms    
                  Option 2. choose SelectAll function, define a model with all the atoms


  

### Function guidelines ###

With MetaChem.

1. you can visualize chemical molecules in augmented reality.
2. you can build your own molecule by hands or importing a PDBML/XML file.
3. you can modify the current structure by adding and deleting atoms.
4. you can adjust the currrent structure by moving, rotating atoms.
5. you can measure the distance, angle and dihedral. 
6. you can operate multiple atoms together.
